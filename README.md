## The purpose of the project
The purpose of the project is to predict a numerical feature – the time of a taxi ride in New York City.
Task: building a machine learning model based on customer data to predict a numerical feature – the time of a taxi ride.

## Stages:
1) The formation of a data set based on several sources of information.
2) Research of the provided data and identification of patterns. 
3) Designing new features using Feature Engineering and identifying the most significant ones when building a model.
4) Building several models and choosing the one that shows the best result for a given metric.

## Team:
1) Ilyin V.B. (https://github.com/Viktor-125142) – building machine learning models based on the linear regression method and the decision tree method.
2) Kravtsov A.V. (https://github.com/Baddogel) – basic analysis of the source data.
3) Efimovich E.A. (https://github.com/johnneon) – elaboration of new features.
4) Kryuchkov V.V. (https://github.com/Tifles) – selection and transformation of characters.
5) Chashnikov S.Yu. (https://github.com/SergeyChashnikov) – exploratory data analysis (EDA).
6) Salov A.S. (https://github.com/TonyStranger404)- building a machine learning model based on the ensemble method and building a final forecast.
